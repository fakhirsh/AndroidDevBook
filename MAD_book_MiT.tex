%% Setting  Options

%% Choose size of your book: Consult your editor to
%% find which size you should use.
%% Choices are: [6x9], [7x9], [7x9wide], and [8x9]

%\documentclass[6x9]{newmath}

%% In addition you can call for the manuscript option, for
%% double spacing:
%\documentclass[manuscript,6x9]{newmath}

%% Another option is `hyper'
%% to turn on the commands found in the hyperref package:
\documentclass[hyper,6x9]{newmath}
% Information on hyperref commands found here:
% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Hyperlinks
% 
% For package options and user commands:
% http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/doc/manual.pdf
% 
% The hyperref package is entered at the very end of the newmath.cls
% file, in case you'd like to make changes to the package options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Cropmarks are used by default. If you  want to turn cropmarks off, type
% \nocropmarks (before \begin{document})

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Author definitions go before \begin{document}

% ie, \def\taupav{\tau_{\mathrm{Pav}}}

% It's better to put definitions in the body of your .tex file
% rather than having a separate file for your macros, which
% can become separated from your .tex file.
